===============================

##Description:

This game is my 5th project for the Udaicty Front-End Web Dev nanodgree.  The goal is to create a classic arcage frogger game using the newly acquired skills in Object Oriented JS and HTML5 Canvas.  Images and a game loop engine are provided.  The rest should be built in app.js file!

##Installation:

To run the application:

1- Download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository onto your local workstation:
    - zip file https://codeload.github.com/DoniaAhmad/ArcadeGame/zip/master
    - git clone https://github.com/DoniaAhmad/ArcadeGame.git
    
2- Open a browser window and navigate to the index.html file in your application's directory.

##How to Play:

Use the arrow keys to move the player across the board. To win you need to reach water, but avoid colliding with the bugs.

##Enjoy it!  :smile:
